# Google Sign-In Setup Guide for Tinkerly

## Issues Fixed in Code

✅ **Fixed AuthService** - Removed corrupted code and improved error handling
✅ **Fixed Register Screen** - Simplified Google Sign-In flow and improved user experience
✅ **Fixed Login Screen** - Added Google Sign-In functionality
✅ **Updated CustomButton** - Added support for icons and custom text colors

## Remaining Configuration Steps

### 1. Firebase Console Configuration

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `tinkerly-a0709`
3. Go to **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
4. Enable **Google** as a sign-in provider
5. Add your authorized domains:
   - `localhost` (for development)
   - Your production domain (when deployed)

### 2. Android Configuration

The `google-services.json` file shows empty `oauth_client` array. You need to:

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Project Settings** → **General**
2. Scroll down to **Your apps** section
3. Click on your Android app (`com.example.tinkerly`)
4. Download the updated `google-services.json` file
5. Replace the existing file in `android/app/google-services.json`

### 3. Web Configuration

The web configuration looks correct with the client ID already set in `web/index.html`.

### 4. iOS Configuration (if needed)

If you plan to support iOS:

1. In Firebase Console, add an iOS app
2. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
3. Add it to your iOS project
4. Update iOS configuration in Xcode

## Testing the Implementation

### For Android:
1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter run`

### For Web:
1. Run `flutter run -d chrome`
2. Test Google Sign-In button

### For iOS:
1. Open iOS simulator or device
2. Run `flutter run`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Google Sign-In failed"
**Solution**: Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in methods → Google is enabled

### Issue: "Network error" on Android
**Solution**: Ensure you have internet connection and Google Play Services is updated

### Issue: "Client ID mismatch" on Web
**Solution**: Verify the client ID in `web/index.html` matches Firebase Console

### Issue: "Sign-in cancelled"
**Solution**: This is normal when user cancels the sign-in process

## Code Improvements Made

1. **Better Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks with specific error messages
2. **User Experience**: Improved loading states and feedback messages
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Unified implementation for web and mobile

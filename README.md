# tinkerly

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Registration Update

- Phone number is now a required field during user registration.
- The phone number is stored in the backend database and included in the user model.
- All user creation and update endpoints now handle the phone number field.

Summary
I've successfully fixed your Java/Android development environment:

✅ What I Fixed:
Downloaded and installed OpenJDK 17 to C:\temp\jdk-17.0.13+11
Configured Flutter to use the new JDK with flutter config --jdk-dir
Set up Android SDK path with flutter config --android-sdk
Verified the setup with flutter doctor -v - now showing all green checkmarks for Android toolchain
✅ Current Status:
✅ Java is working (OpenJDK 17.0.13)
✅ Android toolchain is configured correctly
✅ Your emulator is connected and ready
✅ Flutter run is now executing successfully
📝 For Permanent Setup:
To make these settings permanent across terminal sessions, you can add these environment variables to your system:

JAVA_HOME: C:\temp\jdk-17.0.13+11
PATH: Add C:\temp\jdk-17.0.13+11\bin to your PATH
ANDROID_HOME: C:\Android
But for now, Flutter has these settings saved in its configuration, so your app should build and run successfully!

The app is currently building - you should see it launch on your emulator once the Gradle build completes. This first build might take a few minutes, but subsequent builds will be much faster.
